# Third Eye For the Visually Impaired
I am working on a device that can potentially help the visually impaired. This wearable innovation allows the blind to easily navigate by detecting nearby obstacles through an ultrasonic wave that then notifies the person with a buzzer sound and vibrator that both speed up as they get closer to the object.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the ultrasonic sensor and the arduino micro to the breadboard. I did this in order to test how if the sensor was working and understand how. Using wires from the sensor to the arduino board, I connected the VCC to the 5V, the trigger pin to 6, the echo pin to 7, and finally the ground pin to the ground on the arduino. Next, I wrote a code that would display the distance of an object in centimeters, on the serial monitor, from the ultrasonic sensor. The closer the object got to the sensor the the smaller the distance is, and the farther the object got the larger the distance appeared. This works because the sensor sends out sound waves the travels to the object and then bounces off it back to the sensor, which then recevies an echo. This pulse allows it to calculate the distance of the sensor from the object.
